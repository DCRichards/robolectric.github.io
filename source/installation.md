# Getting Started

If you're using Maven or Gradle, we have template projects checked into GitHub that will get you up and running
tests in no time at all. For Maven use [deckard-maven](http://github.com/robolectric/deckard-maven) and for Gradle
use [deckard-gradle](http://github.com/robolectric/deckard-gradle). Full instructions are available in those repositories.

## IntelliJ or Android Studio

If you're using JetBrains' excellent [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), either of the above projects
will import cleanly. If you're using Android Studio (which is based on IntelliJ), they should both work as well.

## Eclipse

If you're using Eclipse, you can try to get it to work by following the
[eclipse quick start instructions](eclipse-quick-start.html). If you try this or get it working otherwise, please
let us know how and help us make the Deckards work for Eclipse.
