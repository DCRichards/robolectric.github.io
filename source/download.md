Robolectric releases are available on [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.robolectric%22).

We recommend using Maven to build your project. Please see the [Maven quick-start guide](maven-quick-start.html) and the Deckard project template.

If you're not using Maven to build your project, you'll probably want to grab the latest
robolectric-X.X.X-jar-with-dependencies.jar from [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22org.robolectric%22).

Pre-2.0 versions of Robolectric are available on [Maven Central under the com.pivotallabs group ID](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cgav%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.pivotallabs%22%20AND%20a%3A%22robolectric%22).
