# Robolectric

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/erd/robolectric.github.io.png?branch=source)](http://travis-ci.org/erd/robolectric.github.io)

This repository is the source for the docs that live at [robolectric.org](http://robolectric.org).

## Contributing

Before submitting a pull request, view the docs locally to check that the content and
layout are correct. You can do this by running:

    middleman server
  
This will build the docs and make them available at [localhost:4567](http://localhost:4567). Once
your pull request is accepted, the docs will be automatically built and pushed to the web by
Travis CI.
